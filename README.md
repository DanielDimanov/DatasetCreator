### Inspired by ZetCode PyQT tutorial

This project is a supplementary mini delivarable to my Instagram Analyser, which can determine Instagram user's interests and personality only by analysing the images using convolutional neural networks. I made this project to enable me to sort the images faster as part of a qualitative research I conducted. It is very simple, yet may prove to be very helpful to some people.

1. The project gets images from folder <i> imagesToSort </i>
2. The image is displayed using PyQT form.
3. When a button is selected the image is automatically moved to the corresponsing folder and the next one is displayed.
4. You can change the labels on the buttons as well as the folders and reuse the application to fit your needs.

Prerequisites:
1. You have python 3 installed (min 3.5)
2. Install PyQT5 (with Conda- conda install pyqt5)
3. run using python3 runner.py in console in the directory.
4. Enjoy!
